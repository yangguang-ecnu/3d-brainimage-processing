## Brain Image processing ##
Neuroimaging processing is an active field all round the world. Interpretation of an Brain Image captured, for example,  with MRI or CT gives a degree information depending on the particular technique. It is necesary to automate some parts of the assesment to accelerate diagnostics.

Based on above, we propouse a collection of rutines and apps which automate some tasks of the assesment.

We mainly focuse our attention in 3D Brain Tumor Reconstruction using Matlab.
